This is a very simple android application to test out the new C2DM feature
from Google. The code is open source and free to use and abuse.

The simplest way to build and install the application is to use the Maven
build script included. For android maven plugin specific help please see the
official website: http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/

There is a matching application server side to this code written in Python. It
will be available under the same terms (I.E no terms at all) when I have time to
put it together.

Please understand that I take no responsibility for any possible damage that
this code causes. It is free to use as is without any warranties.
